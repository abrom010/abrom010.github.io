        <h2>Wake On Lan Redirect</h2>
        <p>
          Even though this was one of my earlier and less complex projects, I
          can still think back on it and feel accomplished. This really was my
          first real project. I had a problem that I couldn't find the solution
          to, so I created the solution, and learned so much in the process. To
          provide a brief explanation, I simply wanted to turn my pc on
          remotely, but my modem would keep forgetting my pc when it was off, so
          I used an spare android phone to wait for the WakeOnLan signal and
          broadcast it.
